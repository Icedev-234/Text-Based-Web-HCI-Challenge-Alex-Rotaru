        <h2 id="Home">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Before the modern websites we have today, there were also the first type of website to ever exist: The Text-Based type Websites.</p>
        <p>In this project, we will be discussing two different aplications that enter in this category. Some may have heard them, some have not.</p>
        <p>Of course, I'm talking about...: </p>
        <p><em>Lynx</em>, the oldest and one of the well known text based browsers we have today.</p>
        <p>And also <em>Browsch</em>,the most recent text-based web browser who made a name for itself through possible reviwes and so on...</p>
        <p><em>A text-based web browser </em> is a web browser that renders only the text of web pages, and ignores most graphic content. Under small bandwidth connections, usually,
             they render pages faster than graphical web browsers due to lowered bandwidth demands. Additionally, the greater CSS, JavaScript and typography functionality 
             of graphical browsers require more CPU resources. They also can be heavily modified to display certain content differently
            Text-based browsers are often very useful for users with visual impairment or partial blindness. They are especially useful with speech synthesis or text-to-speech software,
             which reads content to users.</p>
      </div>

      
      <div class="box">
        <h2 id="About"> About the said applications</h2>
       <p><em>Lynx</em> is a customizable text-based web browser for use on cursor-addressable character cell terminals.</p>
       <p>As metioned earlier, Lynx is one of the oldest text-based web-Broswer we have today since the browser itself was made in 1992.</p>
        <p>Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic Computing Services of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas"> University of Kansas</a>, and was 
            initially developed in 1992 by a team of students and staff at the university (Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac) as a 
            <a href="hypertext">hypertext</a> browser used solely to distribute campus information as part of a Campus-Wide Information Server and for browsing the 
            Gopher space.</p>

        <p>The Browsh web browser represents web pages as text and can be run either from a terminal client environment or from a web browser. As of August 2018 the web browser client remains 
            less developed. It has been developed since 23 April 2016. It uses Go as a core part of its implementation. Browsh uses a headless version of Mozilla Firefox to fetch and parse web 
            pages.

        <h2 id="Browsh">Browsch-The modern text-based Web</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the reception this web browser receives,this may be seen as a modern 
          replacement for the Lynx text-based web browser. One sole reason for this opinion is that sometimes showing
        the web in text format is someitmes impractical at best.</p>
      </div>

      
      <div class="box">
        <h2 id="TWB">What makes a good Web Browser?</h2>
        <p>When it comes to web browsers in general, the one thing we should keep an eye out for is that the functions/comands present
        are simple to understand and being able to "surf the web" with ease. All of it depends of the user's preferences in that said website.</p>
        <img id="image" src="./User_Flow-2048x1318.jpg">
        <p>The image shown above consists in how usually a user intereacts with the website he's trying to use. Being text-based or not is not an issue in itself.</p>
        <p>Both aplications respect that kind of simplicity since you only rely on text comands for simple functions such as visiting a link and so on.</p>
        <p>This is how a user usually operates in Lynx:</p>
        <img id="image" src="./Notes or Drawings/IMG_20230322_233744.jpg">
        <p>And this is how the user operates in Browsch:</p>
        <img id="image" src="./Notes or Drawings/IMG_20230322_233759.jpg">
      </div>

      
      <div class="box">
        <h2 id="TUI"> TUI Controls</h2>
      <p>In <em>Lynx</em>'s case, all neecesary commands are shown at the bottom of the terminal the user is running:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-Press left to go to link </li>
        <li>-Press right to go to previous link </li>
        <li>-Pressing H for help for more comands the user can... well... use</li>
        <li>Etc</li>
        <p>The image below represents how the user interracts with the comands given to him:</p>
        <img id="image" src="./Notes or Drawings/IMG_20230323_093652.jpg">
      </ul>
      <p> In my opinion, the user won't have any trouble in remembering the essential commands necesary to navigate.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to <em>Browsch</em>, it is a special case for the user. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>-Most of its functions are the same as the normal browswer type.</li>
        <li>-Exploration is the same.</li>
        <li>-Can do wahtever a graphcial browser can.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2 id="Laws">Are the Empiric Laws Necesary?</h2>
        <p>Regardless od what kind of browser we chose to use, it doesn't change the fact that most of the laws we use in the
          modern browser, the same can be true for text-based ones. Here are some reasons why. But since Browsh is just like the modern web browsers,
          but too pixelated, we will only be taking Lynx in consideration in oder to identify those said laws in text-based browsers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. <strong>Fitt's Law </strong> can be adapted with Text-Based websites like Browsh where we need to click in order to enter URL. The less content, the faster we can navigate.</li>
          <li>2. <strong> Hick's Law </strong> can be addapted with the choices the user has in these said browsers. Those choices are considered in the comands that can execute.
